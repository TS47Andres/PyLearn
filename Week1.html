                <h3>What is Python ? Its History and Applications.</h3>
                <p>Python is more than just a programming language; it's a philosophy embodied in code. Its core
                    principles emphasize readability and a clean, uncluttered syntax, making it feel almost like writing
                    in plain English.</p>
                <h4>A Brief History</h4>
                <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for
                    Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. It's a successor to the ABC language, which was
                    intended as a teaching language. Guido van Rossum named it after the BBC comedy series "Monty
                    Python's Flying Circus." The first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in 1991.</p>
                <h4>Key Characteristics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interpreted:</strong> Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, meaning
                        you don't need to compile it into machine code before running it. This makes development faster.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamically Typed:</strong> You don't need to declare the data type of a variable
                        explicitly. Python figures it out at runtime.</li>
                    <li><strong>High-Level:</strong> Python's syntax is far removed from the low-level details of
                        computer hardware, allowing you to focus on problem-solving.</li>
                    <li><strong>General-Purpose:</strong> As you'll see, Python is used in a wide variety of domains.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts,
                        which help in organizing and structuring complex code (we'll touch on this later in the course).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Diverse Applications</h4>
                <p>Python's versatility is one of its greatest strengths. Here are some key areas where Python shines:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Frameworks like Django and Flask make building robust and
                        scalable web applications easier than ever.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Science and Machine Learning:</strong> Python is the dominant language in this
                        field, with powerful libraries like NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data manipulation,
                        Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for machine learning
                        algorithms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scientific Computing:</strong> Researchers and engineers use Python for simulations,
                        data analysis, and modeling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automation and Scripting:</strong> Automating repetitive tasks, system administration,
                        and creating utility scripts are common uses of Python.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Libraries like Pygame allow for the creation of 2D games.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Desktop Applications:</strong> Frameworks like Tkinter and PyQt can be used to build
                        graphical user interfaces (GUIs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing and Quality Assurance:</strong> Python is used for writing test scripts and
                        automating testing processes.</li>

                <h3>Running your First Python Program: Hello, World!</h3>
                <p>It's a tradition in programming to start with a simple program that displays the message "Hello,
                    World!". This helps you verify that your Python installation and code editor are working correctly.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Open your Code Editor:</strong> Launch the code editor you installed (VS Code, PyCharm,
                        Sublime Text, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Create a New File:</strong> In your editor, go to "File" > "New File" (or a similar
                        option).</li>
                    <li><strong>Write Your Code:</strong> Type the following line of Python code into the empty file:
                        <pre><code class="code-snippet"><span class="code-function">print</span>(<span class="code-string">"Hello, Python!"</span>)</code></pre>
                        <p>The <code>print()</code> function is a built-in Python function that displays output to the
                            console.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Save the File:</strong> Go to "File" > "Save As" (or a similar option). Choose a
                        location on your computer where you want to save your Python files (e.g., a "PythonProjects"
                        folder in your Documents). Name the file <code>hello.py</code>. <strong>It's crucial to use the
                            `.py` extension to tell your computer that this is a Python file.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Open your Terminal or Command Prompt:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Press the Windows key, type "cmd", and press Enter.</li>
                            <li><strong>macOS:</strong> Open "Terminal" from Applications > Utilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Linux:</strong> Open your terminal application (usually Ctrl+Alt+T or accessible
                                from your application menu).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Navigate to the Directory:</strong> Use the <code>cd</code> (change directory) command
                        to navigate to the folder where you saved <code>hello.py</code>. For example, if you saved it in
                        a "PythonProjects" folder in your "Documents":
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Windows:</strong> <pre><code class="code-snippet">cd Documents\PythonProjects</code></li>
                            <li><strong>macOS/Linux:</strong> <pre><code class="code-snippet">cd Documents/PythonProjects</code></pre> (Note the forward
                                slash on macOS and Linux)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can use the <pre><code class="code-snippet">ls</code></pre> (on macOS/Linux) or <pre><code class="code-snippet">dir</code></pre> (on Windows) command to
                            list the files in the current directory and verify that <code>hello.py</code> is there.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Run the Program:</strong> Once you are in the correct directory, execute the Python
                        script by typing:
                        <ul>
                            <li><pre><code class="code-snippet">python hello.py</code></pre> (on some systems)</li>
                            <li><pre><code class="code-snippet">python3 hello.py</code></pre> (more common on macOS and Linux)</li>
                        </ul>
                        Press Enter.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>See the Output:</strong> If everything is set up correctly, you should see the following
                        output printed in your terminal:
                        <pre><code class="code-snippet">Hello, Python!</code></pre>
                        <p>Congratulations! You have successfully written and run your first Python program.</p>
                    </li>

                <h3>Basic Syntax and Conventions: The Building Blocks of Python Code.</h3>
                <p>Like any language, Python has its own set of rules and conventions that govern how code is written.
                    Understanding these basics is essential for writing correct and readable Python programs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Indentation: The Heart of Python Structure:</strong> Unlike many other programming
                        languages that use curly braces <code>{}</code> to define blocks of code (like loops,
                        conditional statements, and functions), Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs).
                        <strong>Consistent indentation is absolutely crucial in Python.</strong> Mixing tabs and spaces
                        can lead to errors. The standard convention is to use 4 spaces for each level of indentation.
                    </li>
                    <pre><code class="code-snippet"><span class="code-keyword">if</span> <span class="code-number">5</span> > <span class="code-number">2</span>:
    <span class="code-function">print</span>(<span class="code-string">"Five is greater than two!"</span>)  <span class="code-comment"># This line is indented, belonging to the if block</span>
<span class="code-keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="code-function">print</span>(<span class="code-string">"Five is not greater than two."</span>) <span class="code-comment"># This line is also indented</span></code></pre>
                    <li><strong>Comments: Explaining Your Code:</strong> Comments are notes that you add to your code to
                        explain what it does. They are ignored by the Python interpreter but are very helpful for making
                        your code understandable to yourself and others. In Python, you use the hash symbol
                        <code>#</code> to start a single-line comment.
                        <pre><code class="code-snippet"><span class="code-comment"># This is a comment explaining the next line of code</span>
<span class="code-variable">name</span> = <span class="code-string">"Alice"</span>  <span class="code-comment"># Assigning the string "Alice" to the variable name</span></code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Case Sensitivity: Distinguishing Characters:</strong> Python is a case-sensitive
                        language. This means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently. So,
                        <code>myVariable</code>, <code>MyVariable</code>, and <code>myvariable</code> are all distinct
                        variables.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Statements: Instructions for the Interpreter:</strong> A statement in Python is a single
                        instruction that the interpreter can execute. Typically, each statement occupies a single line.
                        However, you can have multiple statements on a single line separated by a semicolon
                        <code>;</code>, although this is generally discouraged for readability.
                        <pre><code class="code-snippet"><span class="code-variable">x</span> = <span class="code-number">5</span>
<span class="code-variable">y</span> = <span class="code-number">10</span>
<span class="code-function">print</span>(<span class="code-variable">x</span> + <span class="code-variable">y</span>)</code></pre>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Line Breaks: Making Code Readable:</strong> While you can technically write long lines
                        of code, it's good practice to keep lines under a certain length (e.g., 79 characters, as
                        suggested by PEP 8, the style guide for Python code). You can break long lines using a backslash
                        <code>\</code> or implicitly inside parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, or braces `{}`.
                        <pre><code class="code-snippet"><span class="code-comment"># Using a backslash for line continuation</span>
<span class="code-variable">long_string</span> = <span class="code-string">"This is a very long string that needs to be "</span> \
              <span class="code-string">"broken into multiple lines for better readability."</span>

<span class="code-comment"># Implicit line continuation inside parentheses</span>
<span class="code-variable">result</span> = (<span class="code-number">1</span> + <span class="code-number">2</span> + <span class="code-number">3</span> +
          <span class="code-number">4</span> + <span class="code-number">5</span> + <span class="code-number">6</span>)</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Variables: Naming Conventions:</strong> We'll dive deeper into variables next week, but
                        it's good to know some basic naming conventions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Variable names should be descriptive and indicate the purpose of the variable.</li>
                            <li>They can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).</li>
                            <li>They cannot start with a number.</li>
                            <li>Spaces are not allowed; use underscores instead (e.g., `user_name`, not `user name`).
                            </li>
                            <li>Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, etc.)
                                as variable names.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding these basic syntax rules will help you write clean, readable, and error-free Python
                    code as you continue your learning journey.</p>
